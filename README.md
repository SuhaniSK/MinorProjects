 Minor Projects (2nd Year Engineering)
This repository contains a set of small projects built during my second year of engineering, demonstrating concepts in object-oriented programming, algorithms, networking, and file parsing.

Projects Overview
-oops.cpp – Enterprise Resource Planning System
  A C++ project implementing core modules of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system using object-oriented programming principles.
-flat.cpp – Question Parsing
  This C++ program generates grammatically correct English questions using a simplified context-free grammar (CFG)
-ada.cpp – Medical Equipment Allocation (Kruskal's Algorithm)
  Implements Kruskal’s algorithm to optimize the allocation of medical equipment in healthcare facilities, modeled as a minimum spanning tree problem.
-client– Client-Server Model using Boost.Asio
  Contains two C++ files:
  client.cpp
  server.cpp
  This project demonstrates a simple client-server communication system using the Boost.Asio networking library, showcasing asynchronous I/O handling in C++.
